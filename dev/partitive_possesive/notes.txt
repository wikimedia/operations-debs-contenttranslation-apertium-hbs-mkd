TODO: A list of words that are more likely to occur with partitive:

Idea, go through a list of Noun Noun + Genitive pairs in the corpus and extract stuff that are either:
	- always partitive
	- always possesive
	- can be both
And make a hard core list for it, include it in translation.

The list of extracted pairs found in the wikipedia corpus is in nominative_genitive_pairs.txt
The complete list from the analyser is in candidates.txt
The extraction script is extract_candidates.sh
